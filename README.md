## 🪖 Code Warrior. Veteran. Builder of Second Chances.

I served from 2001–2003(Army 1999-2003).
Came home broken, lost a friend, nearly lost myself. Then I found purpose in code.

**No handouts. No shortcuts. One mission: Build tools that matter.**

  → From template junk to handcrafted digital presence

## 🧠 From the Inside Out

> In 2023, with zero tech background.
> No laptop experience. No GitHub. No roadmap. Just fire.

- Everything started for me from joining a basic web design course through Brave Behind Bars while in prison.
- Taught myself full-stack dev in isolation — Flask, JS, Jinja, CLI scripting
- Earned certifications from **Google**, **UC Davis**, **University of Michigan** and every online course I could find!
- Went from student to TA — teaching others to build the same way I did
- Now I build software that runs offline, under pressure, and without excuses

## ⚔️ My Ethos

- **Code like your life depends on it.**
- **No fluff. No gimmicks. Just raw function and impact.**
- **If it doesn’t run offline, it’s not ready for the real world.**
- **Accessibility > Aesthetics. Clarity > Cleverness.**

## 🛠 Dev Arsenal

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bash, Batch
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap
- **Tools**: Visual Studio (custom extensions), BrowserSync, PyInstaller
